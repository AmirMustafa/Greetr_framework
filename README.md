# Greetr_framework

A JQuery inspired framework, written in Vanilla JS. Following some good practices like:

- Not always using new keyword directly from user end, instead a function will do it for us.
- Making methods chainable, so that a user can chain methods in his js script (done by returning this)
- Taking advantage of JS prototype creating many functionalities. It reduces space coplexity.
- Using shorter symbol i.e. G$() inspired from jQuery (i.e. $)
